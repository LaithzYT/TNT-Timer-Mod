# TNT-Timer-Mod
Displays a timer for when a tnt is about to blow, works with erics mod system. ( also no need to credit me for this shit its basic asf )

this is tnttimer made by bluepvp credit to him this is a modified version so it is toggleable and you need to have erics modtogglegui or your own toggle gui using erics mod system for this to work

1 : First go in RenderTNTPrimed.java and copy paste all the code from here to the class and import and stuff.
2 : Make a class called ModTNTTimer in mod implementations and add the code from ModTNTTimer.java to there.
3 : Then go in your ModInstances and then add the code from ModInstances.java to your modinstances class.

Thats it you can try running it and see if it works, and if there are any problems feel free to dm me for help at MST__mamdshakurthakur221#8683
